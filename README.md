# allgood

## Overview

Welcome to the `allgood` project, where every HTTP response is a success! This Go package provides a middleware for the Fiber web framework that ensures every response has a status code of 200 OK, regardless of the actual outcome of the request. 

## Explanation

In the realm of HTTP communication, status codes are used to convey the result of a client's request to a server. The `200 OK` status code is the universal symbol of success, indicating that the request has been successfully processed. However, in a world filled with uncertainty and error-prone systems, achieving a consistent `200 OK` can be challenging.

The `allgood` middleware leverages the principles of positive reinforcement and cognitive dissonance to create an environment where every request is perceived as successful. By overriding the status code of every response to `200 OK`, we ensure that both clients and servers experience a harmonious interaction, free from the burdens of error handling and failure management.
